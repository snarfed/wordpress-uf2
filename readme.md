Adds microformats2 classes to your WordPress theme. It is only a very basic implementation, because not every element is accessible through actions or filters. I would recommend to use a theme that supports [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2), like [SemPress](https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress).
